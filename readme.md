I find myself writing the same code over and over again, this is an effort to solve a problem once and stop reinventing the wheel. I think everyone should do this! I'm all for modularity! I think that functions, very small pieces of code that do one thing should rule the world! The thing is it's hard to manage small pieces of code. I'm dumping this repo with anything and everything simple. If we're lucky people will set a standard for building their own util libraries and we'll be able to build out own out of what we need, everyone borrowing from everyone else. No more gists, everything gets dumped into here, one mega function hub. No more setting up a repo and package for each simple 30 line function.
